            <h3>Profile</h3>
            <p> 
                Experienced IT Service Desk Analyst currently working in a hospital environment. Graduated from the National College of Ireland with a BSc in Computing. 
                From designing and creating basic websites using HTML, CSS and Javascript I moved onto using frameworks to build more advanced, interactive web applications. 
                From there my love of software development has grown. Specialising in IoT (Internet of Things), for my final year project I designed and built a Smart Irrigation 
                System to allow the automated watering of soil samples. The automated system was built using Python, Java, a Raspberry Pi and a collection of sensors.
                Currently enrolled in a 12 week online Python course with a view getting my MTA: Introduction to Programming Using Python certificate by the end of 2020.
                With a passion for software development and skills in Java, Python and Javascript I am also looking to grow my programming abilities and improve my React, MongoDB and C++ skill set.
